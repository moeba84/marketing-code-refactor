Improving HTML semantics and accessibility and optimizing CSS!

I built this project so I could learn HTML and CSS basics. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML semantics. I learned about elements, class vs. id, and how to link css to my HTML and how to follow the path. I was able to understand why it's important to use certain elements to explain the content on the page and how its broken up. By optimizing the CSS i was able to condense the code so that i didn't have a bunch of repetive lines of essentially the same code. I enjoyed learning how the HTML and CSS work together and it was fun making and understanding the connection between the two.
